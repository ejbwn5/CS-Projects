# Ed Bateman's Computer Science Projects

This is a collection of some programming projects I have done. They're split into projects I did for/at school and projects that I did on my own accord.

Some of my most notable projects:
- [Edputer](Personal%20Projects/Edputer/)
  - 16-bit computer I designed, along with the Emulator, Assembler and C-like programming language compiler created for it
- [My Wordle Solver](Personal%20Projects/Wordle%20Solver/)
  - Wordle is a word guessing game that's become pretty popular lately. This is the program I wrote that automatically plays them on [wordle.berknation.com](https://wordle.berknation.com/)
- [Formula SAE Wireless Lap Timer](School%20Projects/Formula%20SAE/Formula%20SAE%20Wireless%20Lap%20Timer/)
  - This is the lap timer that I designed for Missouri S&T's Formula SAE racing team during the Spring 2021 semester. 
- [My Chess AI](School%20Projects/Chess%20AI/)
  - This is the Chess AI that I wrote for my Artificial Intelligence class during the Spring 2021 semester
