# Bezier Curves

This is a program I wrote in Python using the matplotlib library to plot nth order [Bezier Curves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9zier_curve). Right clicking creates a new control point, and left click + dragging moves existing points. The plot can be cleared by pressing the backspace or delete key.
