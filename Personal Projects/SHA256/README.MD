# SHA256

This is a small project I did in August 2021. I got interested in hash algorithms around then and so I decided to try implementing the SHA256 algorithm in C++. 

I included an Example image in this repo showing a comparison of my program's output versus an online SHA256 calculator. I used my programs source code itself as the input string. I also demonstrated the algorithm being run on the bitstring "011010" instead of a normal character string.
