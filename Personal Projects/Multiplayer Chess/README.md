# Multiplayer Chess

This is a simple Chess implementation in Win32 C++ for Windows I made in July 2018. I developed this with Visual Studio 2015. It supports multiplayer via direct peer-to-peer connection.

Chess.sln is the Visual Studio solution file. All of the code is in the Chess folder, and a compiled executable is in the x64/Release folder.
