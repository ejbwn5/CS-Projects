# Pascal's Triangle Calculator

This is a project I did in August 1021. This calculates values of Pascal's Triangle using recursion. I used memoization to cache completed subproblems to make it efficient. 

I also included a custom data type `BigInt` for the purpose of storing very large integer numbers in the form of strings. This was because the numbers this program is capable of calculating far exceeds the biggest integer type, `long long int`.

I included an example image showing some test cases.
