# Edputer Space Invaders

This is a program I wrote to resemble the classic Space Invaders arcade game. Every level, 3 rows of alien ships appear and shoot at the player. You need to dodge incoming shots and shoot back at the alien ships until they are all destroyed. At the start of every level, the type of alien ships that spawn in a row is random, and the colors of the alien ships are all randomly changed. There are 3 different types of alien ships, and each one shoots at different speeds.
