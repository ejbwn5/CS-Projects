# Edputer Pacman

This is a program I wrote to resemble the classic Pacman arcade game. This game is still a work in progress. The ghosts follow the original rules of the game, including a scatter mode followed by a chase mode, and the actual algorithms used by the ghosts to determine where they should move. Unfortunately, these calculations are quite expensive, and make the game run pretty slow. I plan on simplifying it to make it run faster in the future. The tunnel warp feature is implemented, and the ghosts spawn conditions are also fully implemented. However, the fruit mechanic has not yet been implemented, so the player is forever restricted to running away for now.
