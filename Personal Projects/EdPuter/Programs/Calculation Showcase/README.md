# Edputer Calculation Showcase

This is a program which simply calculates some numbers and writes them to the screen. The yellow number is simply a counter which increments by 1 each frame. The green number calculates the summation of integers from 0 to the current value of the yellow number. The red number calculates values from the Fibonacci sequence, but starts over often because the numbers quickly get too large to fit in a 16-bit integer.
