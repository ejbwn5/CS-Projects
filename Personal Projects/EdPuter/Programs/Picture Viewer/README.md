# Picture Viewer

This program switches back and forth between two images in a loop. The images were taken from the internet, resized to 100x75px, and made to fit my 64-color palette using [Floyd-Steinberg Dithering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd%E2%80%93Steinberg_dithering). I then used **EdputerImageRipper.py** to transform the image into an array of simple byte data, and then pasted the array into the program.
